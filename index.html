                    In this project three csv datafiles are analysed using various techniques.
                    The datafiles contain sales data of 40 different stores from January 2010 to December 2012. All 40 stores are categorized in three different store types, A, B and C.
                    The outcome of this analysis is a dashbboard designed with flexdashboard. It highlights the results per type of store.
                    Gauge charts measure sales results quarter 2 2012 vs 2nd quarter 2011.
